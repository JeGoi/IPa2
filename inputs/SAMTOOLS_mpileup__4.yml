    helpSupplementary   : samtools mpileup [-EBugp] [-C capQcoef] [-r reg] [-f in.fa] [-l list] [-Q minBaseQ] [-q minMapQ] in.bam [in2.bam [...]] Generate VCF, BCF or pileup for one or multiple BAM files.
    desc                : Alignment records are grouped by sample (SM) identifiers in @RG header lines. If sample identifiers are absent, each input file is regarded as one sample. In the pileup format (without -u or -g), each line represents a genomic position, consisting of chromosome name, 1-based coordinate, reference base, the number of reads covering the site, read bases, base qualities and alignment mapping qualities. Information on match, mismatch, indel, strand, mapping quality and start and end of a read are all encoded at the read base column. At this column, a dot stands for a match to the reference base on the forward strand, a comma for a match on the reverse strand, a '>' or '<' for a reference skip, `ACGTN' for a mismatch on the forward strand and `acgtn' for a mismatch on the reverse strand. A pattern `\\+[0-9]+[ACGTNacgtn]+' indicates there is an insertion between this reference position and the next reference position. The length of the insertion is given by the integer in the pattern, followed by the inserted sequence. Similarly, a pattern `-[0-9]+[ACGTNacgtn]+' represents a deletion from the reference. The deleted bases will be presented as `*' in the following lines. Also at the read base column, a symbol `^' marks the start of a read. The ASCII of the character following `^' minus 33 gives the mapping quality. A symbol `$' marks the end of a read segment. Note that there are two orthogonal ways to specify locations in the input file; via -r region and -l file. The former uses (and requires) an index to do random access while the latter streams through the file contents filtering out the specified regions, requiring no index. The two may be used in conjunction. For example a BED file containing locations of genes in chromosome 20 could be specified using -r 20 -l chr20.bed, meaning that the index is used to find chromosome 20 and then it is filtered for the regions listed in the bed file.

##-6, --illumina1.3+
##Assume the quality is in the Illumina 1.3+ encoding.
#
#-A, --count-orphans
#Do not skip anomalous read pairs in variant calling.
#
#-b, --bam-list FILE
#List of input BAM files, one file per line [null]
#
#-B, --no-BAQ
#Disable probabilistic realignment for the computation of base alignment quality (BAQ). BAQ is the Phred-scaled probability of a read base being misaligned. Applying this option greatly helps to reduce false SNPs caused by misalignments.
#
#-C, --adjust-MQ INT
#Coefficient for downgrading mapping quality for reads containing excessive mismatches. Given a read with a phred-scaled probability q of being generated from the mapped position, the new mapping quality is about sqrt((INT-q)/INT)*INT. A zero value disables this functionality; if enabled, the recommended value for BWA is 50. [0]
#
#-d, --max-depth INT
#At a position, read maximally INT reads per input file. Note that samtools has a minimum value of 8000/n where n is the number of input files given to mpileup. This means the default is highly likely to be increased. Once above the cross-sample minimum of 8000 the -d parameter will have an effect. [250]
#
#-E, --redo-BAQ
#Recalculate BAQ on the fly, ignore existing BQ tags
#
##-f, --fasta-ref FILE
##The faidx-indexed reference file in the FASTA format. The file can be optionally compressed by bgzip. [null]
#
#-G, --exclude-RG FILE
#Exclude reads from readgroups listed in FILE (one @RG-ID per line)
#
##-l, --positions FILE
##BED or position list file containing a list of regions or sites where pileup or BCF should be generated. Position list files contain two columns (chromosome and position) and start counting from 1. BED files contain at least 3 columns (chromosome, start and end position) and are 0-based half-open.
##While it is possible to mix both position-list and BED coordinates in the same file, this is strongly ill advised due to the differing coordinate systems. [null]
#
#-q, -min-MQ INT
#Minimum mapping quality for an alignment to be used [0]
#
#-Q, --min-BQ INT
#Minimum base quality for a base to be considered [13]
#
#-r, --region STR
#Only generate pileup in region. Requires the BAM files to be indexed. If used in conjunction with -l then considers the intersection of the two requests. STR [all sites]
#
#-R, --ignore-RG
#Ignore RG tags. Treat all reads in one BAM as one sample.
#
#--rf, --incl-flags STR|INT
#Required flags: skip reads with mask bits unset [null]
#
#--ff, --excl-flags STR|INT
#Filter flags: skip reads with mask bits set [UNMAP,SECONDARY,QCFAIL,DUP]
#
#-x, --ignore-overlaps
#Disable read-pair overlap detection.
#
#
#Output Options:
#
#-o, --output FILE
#Write pileup or VCF/BCF output to FILE, rather than the default of standard output.
#
#(The same short option is used for both --open-prob and --output. If -o's argument contains any non-digit characters other than a leading + or - sign, it is interpreted as --output. Usually the filename extension will take care of this, but to write to an entirely numeric filename use -o ./123 or --output 123.)
#
##-g, --BCF
##Compute genotype likelihoods and output them in the binary call format (BCF). As of v1.0, this is BCF2 which is incompatible with the BCF1 format produced by previous (0.1.x) versions of samtools.
#
#-v, --VCF
#Compute genotype likelihoods and output them in the variant call format (VCF). Output is bgzip-compressed VCF unless -u option is set.
#
#Output Options for mpileup format (without -g or -v):
#
#-O, --output-BP
#Output base positions on reads.
#
#-s, --output-MQ
#Output mapping quality.
#
#-a
#Output all positions, including those with zero depth.
#
#-a -a, -aa
#Output absolutely all positions, including unused reference sequences. Note that when used in conjunction with a BED file the -a option may sometimes operate as if -aa was specified if the reference sequence has coverage outside of the region specified in the BED file.
#
#Output Options for VCF/BCF format (with -g or -v):
#
#-D
#Output per-sample read depth [DEPRECATED - use -t DP instead]
#
#-S
#Output per-sample Phred-scaled strand bias P-value [DEPRECATED - use -t SP instead]
#
#-t, --output-tags LIST
#Comma-separated list of FORMAT and INFO tags to output (case-insensitive): AD (Allelic depth, FORMAT), INFO/AD (Total allelic depth, INFO), ADF (Allelic depths on the forward strand, FORMAT), INFO/ADF (Total allelic depths on the forward strand, INFO), ADR (Allelic depths on the reverse strand, FORMAT), INFO/ADR (Total allelic depths on the reverse strand, INFO), DP (Number of high-quality bases, FORMAT), DV (Deprecated in favor of AD; Number of high-quality non-reference bases, FORMAT), DPR (Deprecated in favor of AD; Number of high-quality bases for each observed allele, FORMAT), INFO/DPR (Number of high-quality bases for each observed allele, INFO), DP4 (Deprecated in favor of ADF and ADR; Number of high-quality ref-forward, ref-reverse, alt-forward and alt-reverse bases, FORMAT), SP (Phred-scaled strand bias P-value, FORMAT) [null]
#
#-u, --uncompressed
#Generate uncompressed VCF/BCF output, which is preferred for piping.
#
#-V
#Output per-sample number of non-reference reads [DEPRECATED - use -t DV instead]
#
#Options for SNP/INDEL Genotype Likelihood Computation (for -g or -v):
#
#-e, --ext-prob INT
#Phred-scaled gap extension sequencing error probability. Reducing INT leads to longer indels. [20]
#
#-F, --gap-frac FLOAT
#Minimum fraction of gapped reads [0.002]
#
#-h, --tandem-qual INT
#Coefficient for modeling homopolymer errors. Given an l-long homopolymer run, the sequencing error of an indel of size s is modeled as INT*s/l. [100]
#
#-I, --skip-indels
#Do not perform INDEL calling
#
#-L, --max-idepth INT
#Skip INDEL calling if the average per-input-file depth is above INT. [250]
#
#-m, --min-ireads INT
#Minimum number gapped reads for indel candidates INT. [1]
#
#-o, --open-prob INT
#Phred-scaled gap open sequencing error probability. Reducing INT leads to more indel calls. [40]
#
#(The same short option is used for both --open-prob and --output. When -o's argument contains only an optional + or - sign followed by the digits 0 to 9, it is interpreted as --open-prob.)
#
#-p, --per-sample-mF
#Apply -m and -F thresholds per sample to increase sensitivity of calling. By default both options are applied to reads pooled from all samples.
#
#-P, --platforms STR
#Comma-delimited list of platforms (determined by @RG-PL) from which indel candidates are obtained. It is recommended to collect indel candidates from sequencing technologies that have low indel error rate such as ILLUMINA. [all]
#
